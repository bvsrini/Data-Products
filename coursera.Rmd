### Documentation for Medicare Expense for an episode 

This App is intented to show the Medicare expenses per episode. Data was obtained from [Spending Per Hospital Patient](https://www.medicare.gov/hospitalcompare/Data/spending-per-hospital-patient.html). For understanding of the terminology used in this app refer to the [Fact-Sheet-MSPB-Spending-Breakdowns-by-Claim-Type-Dec-2014.pdf](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-Instruments/hospital-value-based-purchasing/Downloads/Fact-Sheet-MSPB-Spending-Breakdowns-by-Claim-Type-Dec-2014.pdf)

### Instructions


1.  Choose  either a "Claim Type" , "Period" or both to see  the comparison map betweeen State's average Medicare spending by episode in USD and Nation's average Medicare spending by episode
    a) The colors on the map in the "Summary" tab should differentiate if for the user selections the spending is higher,lower or equal to the Nation's Average. In some cases there is no data. 
    b) Selecting a "State" does not affect the "Summary" tab.
    c) A map should appear with the initial selections by default. However it does take a little while to show up.if you make a selection the data does appear faster.
2. Choose  either a "Claim Type" , "Period" , "State" or  all to see the detail "Medicare Data" or to see the Heat map by state.
3. You can navidate the data or filter them through  column wise search or table search options in the table. 
4. The data in the heat map is displayed at a hospital level. It indicates the spending by episode for these hospitals based on various "Claim Type"  and "Periods"
    a) The darker blue indicates a higher spending while light cream color indicates a lower spending. 
    b) The heat map is arranged by means of the columns so you can easily see which "Claim Type" and "Period" have the most spending   
    c) The column names are abbreviated for lack of real estate in the plot. Column names are concatenation of "Claim Type"and "Period". All the columns represent  "Average Spending for an episode in an Hospital". Here are details

### Data Considerations and Processing

 1. The Medicare spending data is computed based on the inputs entered by the user as described above
 
 2. For the "Summary" map tab,  data for all the claim Types and Periods except "Complete Episode" and "Total" were not considered since the data desired is at an individual claim type and a Period. The "Avg Spending Per Episode (State)" was considered for the plot. Here the provider_number was ignored. 

3. For the "Heat Map" data for all the claim Types and Periods except "Complete Episode" and "Total" were not considered since the data desired is at an individual claim type and a Period. The "Avg Spending Per Episode (Hosp)" was considered for the plot. Here the provider_number was ignored.Where there were duplicates Max spending of all providers was considered.
